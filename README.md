This repository contains two folders: GradientBoostedTrees and LinearRegression.

The first folder has 4 Jupyter Notebooks which walkthrough a basic gradient boosting algorithm and a few other variants.  The LinearRegression folder contains a few linear regression models which use closed form solutions to solve for the coefficients and only contains the implementation of the models.
